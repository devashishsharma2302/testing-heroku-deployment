Welcome to squealy's documentation!
----------------------------------------

About Squealy
==============
Squealy is a django app for auto-generating reporting APIs. All configurations are passed through a single **.yml** file, which includes sql queries to fetch report data for each API.

There is support for auto-formatting the data to google charts and highcharts format for quick dashboard integration.

Squealy also supports sql templates based on `jinjasql <https://github.com/hashedin/jinjasql>`_, hence, complex parameterized sql queries can be written.

Squealy-generated APIs are based on `Django Rest Framework <http://www.django-rest-framework.org/>`_. All APIs can be easily configured to use the authentication classes provided by django rest framework.

Squealy supports parameter level and API level validation/authorization as well.

Squealy is highly customizable.


Installation Instructions
=====================================================

From pip (recommended):

.. code-block:: console
		
     pip install squealy

From the source:

.. code-block:: console
     
     git clone https://github.com/hashedin/squealy
     cd squealy
     sudo python setup.py install
|
|
Minimalistic Usage
===================
Since Squealy is based on django rest framework, you can create class based ApiViews easily.

.. code-block:: python
    
    from squealy.views import SqlApiView
    
    class DatabaseTableReport(SqlApiView):
        query = "select name, sql from sqlite_master limit {{params.limit}};"


Just this much and your reporting API is ready for use.

Getting Started with YAML
=====================================================
Building class based APIs is cool, but squealy provides a better way to create multiple APIs just by passing one configuration file.

Lets build some simple APIs that fetch some data from database via SQL query.

1. **Database Connection**: Squealy APIs can use any of the connections made in settings.py, via **connection_name** property which defaults to the **default** connection. For now, lets assume that the default connection is setup in settings.py.


2. **YAML file:** Create a .yml file anywhere in your project providing the API configurations. The structure of this file is defined in detail below. For now, lets start with a minimal configuration to create 2 APIs.

.. code-block:: yaml
 
 ---
 id: api1
 url: api1
 query: >
    select name, sql from sqlite_master limit 5;
 ---
 id: api2
 url: api2

 query: >
    select name, sql from sqlite_master limit {{params.limit}};
 ---


3. **APIs Generation:** Use the ApiGenerator class to generate the squealy APIs inside your project's **urls.py**.

.. code-block:: python

 from squealy.apigenerator import ApiGenerator
 from os.path import dirname, abspath, join

 # Generate the file path to your *.yml file
 YAML_ROOT = join(dirname(abspath(__file__)), "yaml")
 file_path = join(YAML_ROOT, "apis.yaml")

 # Generate url objects
 squealy_urls = ApiGenerator.generate_urls_from_yaml(file_path)

 urlpatterns = [
     url(r'^squealy/', include(squealy_urls)),
 ]


4. **Test the APIs:**
   
 Run the server:

.. code-block:: console
 
    python manage.py runserver

 

|

| That's it! you can now test your APIs in your browser at the following urls:
| (assuming the server running on port 8000)


.. code-block:

  http://localhost:8000/squealy/api1
  http://localhost:8000/squealy/api2/?limit=10

Yaml Configuration
=====================================================
The .yml file serves as the sole input for all sorts of API configurations.
The .yml file can have multiple docs (or, APIs) separated by three dashes (- - -). 

Following are the supported arguments in detail.
The mandatory arguments are appended with an asterisk(*) sign.

|id|
******

.. |id| raw:: html

   id<sup>*</sup>

This is a unique id given to each API. It is used internally by squealy for creating ApiView classes.

|url|
******

.. |url| raw:: html

   url<sup>*</sup>

This is the url endpoint to the API. **Do not prepend the url with a '/'.**

|query|
********

.. |query| raw:: html

   query<sup>*</sup>

This is the SQL query, or, more precisely, a `jinjasql <https://github.com/hashedin/jinjasql>`_ template with parameters bind in the query. The parameters can be extracted from the session or the GET request. The parameters are explained in detail later below.

parameters
***********

This is a dictionary with parameter names as keys and value is further a dictionary with parameter config. The different parameter configurations are listed below.

.. code-block:: yaml

 parameters:
            param1:
                 type: string
                 default_value: somestring
                 optional: True [False by default]
            param2:
                 type: date
                 format: "DD/MM/YYYY"
            param3:
                 type: datetime
                 format: "DD/MM/YYYY HH:mm:ss"

|
 
 There are some in-buit macros supported:
  - Date - 'today', 'current_day', 'tomorrow', 'next_day'
  - Datetime - 'today', 'now' 

 You can extend the **squealy.parameters.Parameter** class and implement the    **to_internal(self, value)** function to create your own parameter type as well.In the yaml file, just give the function path like, 'myapp.somepackage.MyCustomParameter'

validations
************

This is a very important and useful feature for API authorization. This is a list of validations which would run with every API call. If anyone of these validations return False, the API would return an error code and the request will be unauthorized.

 The **validation_function** attribute is a path to the function that is to be used     to run the validation. This can be a **user defined function** or one of the functions  defined in the **'squealy.validators'** module.

 The validation_function must of the following signature:
  Boolean foo(api, params, user, ...any_other_args):

 The **api** is the complete ApiView object, **params** contains the parameter values passes through the url, **user** is the request.user object which can be used to extract session data.

 There is a pre-defined function 'squealy.validators.run_query' which takes a sql query and if that query retutrns any rows, then the validation is passed.

.. code-block:: yaml

   validations:
    -
        error_message: "Invalid parameter: name"
        error_code: 403
        validation_function:
                            name: 'squealy.validators.run_query'
                            kwargs:
                                   query: >
                                            select name from sqlite_master where {{params.name}} in ("django_migrations");
    -
        error_message: "Custom Validation Failed"
        error_code: 403
        validation_function:
                            name: 'exampleapp.custom_validators.validate_user_id'

authentication_classes
***********************

This is a list of django rest framework `authentication classes <http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/authentication/>`_ which would be applied to the generated APIs.

.. code-block:: yaml

   authentication_classes:
     - SessionAuthentication
     - BasicAuthentication
     - TokenAuthentication

permission_classes
*******************

This is a list of django rest framework permission classes which would be applied to the generated APIs.

.. code-block:: yaml

   permission_classes:
     - IsAuthenticated

transformations
****************

Squealy supports some transformations which can be very helpful to transform the response data. Below are the supported transformations:

 - **transpose**: This transposes the output table.
 - **merge**: merge two columns into a new column.
 - **split**: pivot the table at a column and re-arrange the metric column accordingly.

  For split transform, it is mandatory to define the columns as well.

.. code-block:: yaml

 columns:
        name:
            type: "dimension"
        sql:
            type: "dimension"
        num:
            type: "metric"

 transformations:
          -
            name: "transpose"
          -
            name: "split"
            kwargs:
                   pivot_column: "name"
          -
            name: "merge"
            kwargs: 
                   columns_to_merge:
                                    - "sql"
                                    - "num"
                   new_column_name: "merged_column"
|

 You can create your **custom transformations** as well. Just extend the 'squealy.tranformers.TableTransformer' class and implement the **transform(self, table)**. In the yaml file inside 'name' key, use the path to your custom transformer class, like 'myapp.somepackage.MyCustomTransformer'

format
*******

The default format is 'SimpleFormatter', which returns the data in json as a 2-D array. Other supporter formats are:

  - 'GoogleChartsFormatter' : for google charts
  - 'HighchartsFormatter': for HighCharts

.. code-block:: yaml

 format: 'GoogleChartsFormatter'

|

 You can create your **custom formatters** as well. Just extend the 'squealy.formatters.Formatter' class and implement the **format(self, table)**. In the yaml file in 'format' key, use the path to your custom formatter class, like 'myapp.somepackage.MyCustomFormatter'
