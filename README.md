# Squealy

Squealy is a django tool for auto-generating reporting APIs and Dynamic dashboards within minutes. Just write queries and generate customizable dashboard APIs within your project. 

Squealy supports sql templates based on [Jinjasql](https://github.com/hashedin/jinjasql/) which uses Jinja2 under the hood, hence, complex parameterized sql queries can be written.

All squealy-generated APIs are based on Django Rest Framework. All APIs can be configured to use the authentication and permission classes provided by django rest framework.

Squealy supports parameter level and API level validation/authorization as well.

Squealy provides an authoring interface where you can connect to your local database, write/debug/validate your queries, create multiple APIs.

Squealy gives you a dashboard design page where you can add charts and connected filters to the dashboard. Drag, Drop and resize the charts and filters the way you want and hit save to create a dashboard rendering API within your project without writing any additional code.

The generated dashboard can also be rendered from a custom (project specific) template easily.
